# Assignment: Trafficlights (React)

A coding assignment for setting timing intervals on traffic signal lights using React. Requested by [Devise](https://devisesthlm.se), Stockholm, on the 12th of September 2022 to guage the proficiency of [TECSmith](https://tecsmith.info).

## Instructions

### Level 1:

Display traffic lights with timing intervals of one second delay between each colour. The animation repeats forever. The colour sequence is done using React states, not CSS animations.

### Level 2:

Display traffic lights with timing intervals of two seconds delay on red, one second delay on yellow, and two seconds delay on green. The animation goes back and forth, repeating forever. The colour sequence is done using React states, not CSS animations.

## Compliments

A big thank you to Devise for giving me an opportunity to provide some solutions to this hyperthetical problem. There are many ways one could approach this assignment, I opted for something that fit the inital outlay of the task - and just jazzed it up a bit!
