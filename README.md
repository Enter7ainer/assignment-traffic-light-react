# Assignment: Trafficlights (React)

A coding assignment for setting timing intervals on traffic signal lights using React. Requested by [Devise](https://devisesthlm.se), Stockholm, to guage the skill set proficiency of Thomas EC. Smith (TECSmith).

Requested on the 12th of September 2022, and updated by [TECSmith](https://tecsmith.info) to include the solutions for objective levels 1 and 2 as defined within the instructions as set out in this repository.

A big thank you to Devise for giving me the opportunity to provide my solutions to this hyperthetical problem, and should you have any further tests, I am more than willing to try them!
